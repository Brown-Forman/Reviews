# Reviews
We had previously talked about using various online restaurant/bar review sites for segmentation work as well.  Not sure what all we can connect to though, but it would be something interesting for us to pursue and narrow down what sites (google, open table, yelp, urban spoon, tripadvisor, etc.) actually would let us access info. So let's have Thi dig up a list of sites that offer restaurant/bar reviews.  It would also be good to capture how those restaurants/bars are rated from cost perspective ($ to $$$ type of thing), as that would be handy for segmentation kind of work.  She should capture if they have API, if they have any restrictions on who/how the data can be used (i.e. in some cases the data might be available for research/educational users only), and any other relevant details.  Once we have that, I can loop in Luke to see if he has dealt with any of them, if he has access to them, etc..
